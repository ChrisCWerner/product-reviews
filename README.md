> Sample code for Opinew&#39;s interview

## Description

As per the technical interview with Opinew, here is a simple Vuejs application to showcase a bit of my understanding with frontend development.

The system should consist basically in a detailed products list page with product name, description, image, price, reviews and other metadata.

## Project setup

For simplification, I've added the [`json-server`](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) dependency inside `package.json` as a dev dependency. The recommended approach is to create a separate project to handle backend services.

```bash
# To install all dependencies:
yarn
```

### Run locally
```bash
# To start up the server, run this in the terminal:
yarn server

# To start up the frontend, run this in a separate terminal:
yarn dev
```

### Lints and fixes files
```bash
yarn lint
```
