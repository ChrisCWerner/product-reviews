> Sample code for Opinew&#39;s interview

## Description

As per the technical interview with Opinew, here is a simple Vuejs application to showcase a bit of my understanding with frontend development.

The system should consist basically in a detailed products list page with product name, description, image, price, reviews and other metadata.

## Project setup
```bash
# To install frontend dependencies:
yarn
